        <h1>react state</h1>
        <p>Any time that you call this.setState, this.setState AUTOMATICALLY calls render as soon as the state has changed.

            Think of this.setState as actually being two things: this.setState, immediately followed by render.

            That is why you can't call this.setState from inside of the render function! this.setState automatically calls render. If render calls this.setState, you will create an infinite loop.</p>
